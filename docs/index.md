# Function as a Container

## About

Lightweight docker containers built with the philosophy of being engineered to solve just one problem, but solving it extremely well. They are "jack of no trades, master of one."

However, they're also built with the purpose of serving as a self-updating standardized image layer repository, which can be used in the modular construction of other containers.

## Usage

These images are built to be versatatile.

- [X] CI/CD Executors
- [X] Installation-free application
- [X] Modular Dockerfile building
- [X] Pre-Commit Hooks

## Integration with my other projects

This repository is tightly integrated with two of my other repositories.

### Modular GitLab-CI

A collection of stackable, extendable templates for use in GitLab-CI. Those templates utilize these images as their runners.

* [:octicons-book-16: Docs](https://donaldrich.gitlab.io/modular-gitlab-ci)

### CI/CD Runners

Images designed for implementation in CI/CD pipelines, but also designed and documented to allow easy use for in-container development, use, testing, etc.
